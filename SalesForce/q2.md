## Make Array Sorted by replacing second array elements

Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, return the minimum number od operations(possibly zero) needed to make arr1 strictly increasing. In one operation, you can choose two indices 0 <= i < arr1.length and 0 <= j < arr2.length and do the assignment arr1[i] = arr2[j]. If there is no way to make arr1 strictly increasing return -1.

Constraints:
1. 1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 20
2. 0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^3

Sample Case 1:
5(size of arr1)
arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 6, 7]
4(size of arr2)
arr2 = [1, 3, 2, 4]

Sample Output 1:
1
Expalanation: arr[1] element will be replaced by arr2[2] element

Sample Case 2:
6(size of arr1)
arr1 = [2, 4, 9, 8, 7, 10]
4(size of arr2)
arr2 = [3, 5, 7, 9]

Sample Output 2:
2
Explanation: arr1[2], arr[4] elements will be replaced by arr2[1] and arr2[3] respectively.
