## Question 32

There are n number of politicians in state. Head of the state wants to make two groups(Not necessary of same size) but unfortunately, not all politicians get along, and several refuse to be put on the same group as that of their enemies.

Given a 2-D array M of size m*2 denoting enemies i. e M[i][1] both are enemies of each other.

Return 1 if it is possible to make exactly two groups otherwise return 0.

Problem Constraints:
1. 2 <= n <= 10^5
2. 1 <= m <= 10^5
3. 1 <= M[i][0], M[i][1] <= N
4. M[i][0] != M[i][1]

Example Input 1:
n = 5
m = 4
1 2
2 3
1 5
2 4
Output: 1

Example Input 2:
n = 4
m = 4
1 4
3 1
4 3
2 1
Output: 0
