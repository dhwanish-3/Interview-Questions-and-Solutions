## Question 31

Given a string fStr and integer k, you need to revers the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them.
If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

Example 1:
Input : fStr = "abcdefg" , k = 2
Output : "badcfeg"

Example 2:
Input : fStr = "arcesium", k = 2
Output : "raceisum"

Constraints:
1. 1 <= fStr.length <= 10^4
2. 1 <= k <= 10^4
