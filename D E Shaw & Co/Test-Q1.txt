Given an integer n and an array of size n.

an array new_arr is created such that 

1. 0 < new_arr[i] <= arr[i] for 0 <= i < n

2. no 2 elements can be same

Find the number of such new_arr

since the output can be very large return the value mod 1e9 + 7 .

sample test 1:

n = 3, arr = [1, 2, 3]

output: 1

sample test 2:

n = 3 arr = [1, 2, 1]

output: 0
